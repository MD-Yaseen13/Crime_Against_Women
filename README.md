# Crimes Against Women in India: Data Analysis (2001-2021) ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of crimes against women in India, covering the years 2001 to 2021. The analysis focuses on understanding patterns, trends, and state-wise distributions of various types of crimes. The insights gained from this analysis aim to highlight areas that require urgent attention and contribute to ongoing efforts to improve women's safety.

## Motivation
The idea of analyzing this dataset came with a heavy heart, knowing that each data point represents a life impacted by violence and injustice. However, the necessity of bringing these issues to light outweighed the initial sadness. Through this project, I hope to contribute to the fight against these heinous crimes and support efforts toward creating a safer environment for women.
